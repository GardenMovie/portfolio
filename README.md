## 🛠️ Design & Technology Choices

- **React + TypeScript**: For type safety and a robust component-based architecture.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid, utility-first styling and easy theming.
- **shadcn/ui**: Used for accessible, customizable UI components that blend well with Tailwind and speed up development.
- **Lucide Icons**: For a modern, consistent icon set.
